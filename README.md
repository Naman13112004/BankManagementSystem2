# Bank Management System
## Made by- Naman and Dibyanshu
We have worked on a Bank Management System using Java which offers the user some features such as creating a bank account, depositing & withdrawing money. We have worked on the interface as well, using HTML and Bootstrap. We have used JSP (Java Server Pages) to link the Java code with our frontend code.

We used the getParameter() method of request object in JSP to get the inputs that the user entered via the form fields on the website. We also used String functions, parse functions of Wrapper classes to work on the data provided.

 We have also displayed all the present bank accounts at the end of our webpage that we have stored in an ArrayList. We also passed these ArrayList to other pages through session object available in JSP.
